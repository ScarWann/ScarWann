- I’m @ScarWann, a Ukrainian student trying to get into programming
- I’m kinda interested in everything at once, from webdev and gamedev to infosec and networking. Cannot say that I know any of these things on a good level though
- Currently learning SDL for my game engine. Gonna learn Vulkan next (or OpenGL if Vulkan turns out to be too complicated) Haven't really thought about how my engine will stand out between every other one though... Maybe it'll be in Rust or something, IDK RN
- Also currently making semi-personal website as a side project (although it's literally for school, albeit it was started as a purely personal project)
- I have some experience with: Python, C++, Bash, HTML, CSS and JS. Also some basic Lua, but only played around with it while making a simple Factorio mod
- Running Ubuntu daily, plan to switch to Arch soon
